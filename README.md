# Covid19-DataAnalysis
The covid 19 dataset was taken from the [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data)

For the visualtization, I have taken the help of geopandas and download the world map from [ArcGis Hub](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/UIA::uia-world-countries-boundaries/data?geometry=-120.234%2C-84.708%2C120.234%2C57.127)

For the prediciton of covid cases, [fbprophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html) model was taken into consideration.

### Getting started

``` conda create -n envname --filename requirements.txt  ```
This will install all the required packages in the conda environment

``` conda activate envname ```
